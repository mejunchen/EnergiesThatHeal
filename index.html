      <h1>Practical with Meridians</h1>
      <h4>In the book "The Energy That heals", Jacques Staehle described two aspects of the practices with the meridian. First, the Meridians are network of energy said to cover the human body, connected with internal organs. 
        Pain or discomfort sometime is the signal that there could be something wrong with one's organs or organicism.
         Cards below show some of the pain associated with the meridians, get to know those meridians and you could be your own doctor by treating the discomfort yourself. So what do you do if you feel pain in parts of your body?
        <ul>
          <li>Boost the Jing points on both sides;</li>
          <li>Boost the Booster point on the same side as the pain;</li>
          <li>Disperse the points surrounding the pain;</li>
          <li>Boost the Meeting points on both sides.</li>

          <h1>Balance with Meridians</h1>
          <h4>The second important aspect Jacques Staehle described is acupoint to boost 
            a meridian in seasons. This section show the acupoints you can use to boost meridians in a season. </h4>

            <h4>It shows Northern Hemishere by default, move the slider to Southern if you are on Southern Hemishere,
            you will see 12 acupoints for the 12 meridians for your current season.</h4>

            <h4> To boost a meridian press on the coresponding acupoint and rotate
            clockwise for about a minute, you only need to carry on the next day with the points which have some reaction, such as having sore or numbness.
            For acupoints that you feel normal, try a few more times but don't carry on if you still feel normal, as our aim here is to balance the meridians,
            we only want to boost the weak meridians. Stop as soon as you feel the points turn normal.

      <h1>Food === Medicine?</h1>
      <h4>Ancient Chinese knew medicine and food are originated from same source, and defined that when you eat with an empty stomach, it is food; 
        when you eat while ill, it is medicine. But then Chinese are known to have a phrase: 
          medicine is more or less poisonous!!!(是药三分毒). That is, if you eat anything while in a unhealthy state, treat them carefully,
          as medicine. To consume food properly, you must:
      </h4>
      <ol>
        <strong>
          <li>Know your energy type, yang or yin. Yang is energetic type, never tiring. Yin is the low energy type. A lot of overweight people are yin type.</li>
          <li>Choose the energy type of food more or less opposite your energy type. Energetic type should have lot of fruits and vegetables. 
            Low energy type should watch the stomach not feeling upset or bloated after each meals, and note what food caused it so as to avoid next time.
            Salty and ice prefixed food are very much yin, do not have too much of them unless you are full of energy all days. </li>
          <li>Do not eat to full, about 70% full is enough. Hard to achieve when you're used to a big portion. </li>
          <li>Chew slowly, turn the food into the finest liquified particles possible.</li>
          <li>For the low energy type, eat more spices. There are many spices to choose from. Why? Different spices are for different parts of the body, 
            one should try different spice to find out which one is best for you.  Ginger, garlic, cinnamon, cloves and cardamon, to name a few.</li>
          <li>Use your natural instinct, in a relaxed state, you should be able to tell bad from good food. The food that you crave should be
            the right food for you (except those too salty, too sweet or fatty highly processed food).
          </li>
          <li>For those who have loss of appetite after sports, a major operation or are recovering from an illness, it is best to have food that is easily digested, such as light porridge.</li>
          <li>Food for thought: Pray before your meal, food needs to be accompanied by good mood...</li>
